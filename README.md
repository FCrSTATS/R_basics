# R Basics with FC rSTATS

FC rSTATS aim to make the basics of learning R accessible to those that wish to learn, but may not have the advantage of access to paid resources or a background in maths of programming.

We recommend that you get RStudio installed with the instructions [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/), then follow along with our basics series listed below. The examples within certainly aren’t exhaustive, but they will give you an accessible introduction into the basic concepts with easy-to-follow examples based (sometimes tenuously!) on topics around football.

This is a R conversion of a tutorial series by [FC Python](https://fcpython.com/python-basics-fcpython). I take no credit for the idea and have their blessing to make this conversion. All text is a direct copy unless changes were relevant. Please follow them on [twitter](www.twitter.com/FC_Python) and if you have a desire to learn Python then they are a fantastic resource!
