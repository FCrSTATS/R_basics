# R Basics with FC rSTATS

FC rSTATS aim to make the basics of learning R accessible to those that wish to learn, but may not have the advantage of access to paid resources or a background in maths of programming.

We recommend that you get RStudio installed with the instructions [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/), then follow along with our basics series listed below. The examples within certainly aren’t exhaustive, but they will give you an accessible introduction into the basic concepts with easy-to-follow examples based (sometimes tenuously!) on topics around football.

FC rSTATS  Crash Course:

1. [Numbers, Strings & Variables](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/R_basics/blob/master/1.NumbersStrings_Variable.md)

2. Comparisons & Logic

3. If Statements

4. For Loops

5. While Loops

6. Lists

7. Dictionaries

8. Python Modules

9. Creating Functions

10. Random with Expected Goals

Once you have a grasp of the concepts above, you should aim to move on to our introduction to data analysis in R. Here, you’ll learn about cleaning and analysing data in R, as well as visualisation of your insights.

If you have any questions, recommendations or requests, please get in touch!

This is a R conversion of a tutorial series by [FC Python](https://fcpython.com/python-basics-fcpython). I take no credit for the idea and have their blessing to make this conversion. All text is a direct copy unless changes were relevant. Please follow them on [twitter](www.twitter.com/FC_Python) and if you have a desire to learn Python then they are a fantastic resource!
